<meta property="og:title" content="Easy Homemade Taco Meat (No Taco Seasoning) - YOURFRIENDSJ" />
<meta property="og:description" content="As some of you probably saw on Instagram, I made taco salad today. I wanted to quickly provide you guys with a quick and easy homemade taco meat recipe. I was feeling for a taco salad this afternoon and didn&#8217;t have any taco seasoning, so I decided to make my own. It&#8217;s not difficult at all and all the seasonings and spices are to be used at your own discretion. I usually guesstimate the spices when I&#8217;m cooking so feel free to tweak it to your own taste buds. This &#8220;taco meat&#8221; can be eaten on almost anything. I&#8217;ve eaten it on rice (in my non-keto days), with veggies, wrapped in a tortilla for burritos, and tacos. I chose to use Roma tomatoes because of their low water content. I didn&#8217;t want my salad to be wet, so I made it a point to choose Roma instead of tomatoes on the vine or hothouse tomatoes. The meat itself would be pretty &#8220;drippy&#8221; if the fat isn&#8217;t drained. I decided to make a taco salad with my homemade taco meat and topped it with sour cream, chopped Roma tomatoes, and old cheddar cheese for that sharpness but you can use any cheese that you like. I would recommend using a cheese with jalapenos for an extra kick. This homemade taco meat recipe is really versatile so have fun with it. Enjoy!" />

</div>                        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>As some of you probably saw on <a href="http://instagram.com/yourfriendsj">Instagram</a>, I made taco salad today. I wanted to quickly provide you guys with a quick and easy homemade taco meat recipe. I was feeling for a taco salad this afternoon and didn&#8217;t have any taco seasoning, so I decided to make my own. It&#8217;s not difficult at all and all the seasonings and spices are to be used at your own discretion. I usually guesstimate the spices when I&#8217;m cooking so feel free to tweak it to your own taste buds.</p>
<p>This &#8220;taco meat&#8221; can be eaten on almost anything. I&#8217;ve eaten it on rice (in my non-keto days), with veggies, wrapped in a <a href="http://yourfriendsj.com/3-ingredient-soft-flour-tortillas/">tortilla</a> for burritos, and tacos. I chose to use Roma tomatoes because of their low water content. I didn&#8217;t want my salad to be wet, so I made it a point to choose Roma instead of tomatoes on the vine or hothouse tomatoes. The meat itself would be pretty &#8220;drippy&#8221; if the fat isn&#8217;t drained. I decided to make a taco salad with my homemade taco meat and topped it with sour cream, chopped Roma tomatoes, and old cheddar cheese for that sharpness but you can use any cheese that you like. I would recommend using a cheese with jalapenos for an extra kick.</p>
<p>This homemade taco meat recipe is really versatile so have fun with it. Enjoy!</p>

Omg! My first successful Keto dessert is here! It&#039;s kind of hard to like sugar free cookies when you know how to make the real thing, and really well too. 🙃

So when I say I actually ate a few and the whole batch didn&#039;t go into the garbage it&#039;s a pretty big deal. I used the @keto.connect Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe as a crutch for measurement and then went on my own way with the flavouring.

I think to give this a more spiced taste I&#039;ll add ground ginger to it next time.  The goal for next time is to work on the spreadability of the cookie. Overall I&#039;m really happy 😭 this is a huge deal for me." title="Cinnamon Spice Cookies 🍪

During the first week of January I was kind of disappointed with my diet. Yes I was still eating a low carb high fat diet but it was filled with fast food and lacked nutritional value. I ended up seeing a decrease in performance and energy levels at the gym as a result.
--
It was at this moment I decided to get back on the meal prep train and really be intentional about the foods I was consuming. Enter meal prep! Meal prepping is amazing because I can calculate my daily macros ahead of time and not have to stress about counting them during the day.

Since Christmas I&#039;ve been figuring out creative ways to get rid of all the turkey in my freezer. Enter this meal 😂I topped this meal up with some cheese to up the fat since turkey is such a lean meat.

Currently I&#039;m kinda over the salads. I&#039;m going back to my roots and eating copious amount of chicken thighs paired with veggies. I like hot meals better anyways. What are your thoughts on Kale? Before I found this salad mix I was very anti Kale 😭 Let me know ⬇️⬇️⬇️" title="Buffalo Turkey Kale Salad 🥗

I have been a bit MIA, not because I&#039;m cheating just because I&#039;m getting back into the motions. My meals have been pretty repetitive this week.. Lots of  salads like this one from from @jimmythegreek.jtg and a lot more @WendysCanada than I&#039;d like to admit, but all Keto, so all good 🤗

Idk if you noticed but I got so hungry after my sesh at the gym that I took a bite before I took the picture 😅. It was delicious.

Say bye to dry ass salads and say yes to Buffalo-fied turkey. I&#039;m still on a high of how good this was y&#039;all. If you&#039;ve been watching my stories, you know I&#039;ve been obsessed with the baby Kale salad mix from @costco_canada .

I got a turkey thigh and sautéed it in my homemade buffalo sauce (recipe on the blog) and topped my salad with it. It was revolutionary, really — truly.

Omg! My first successful Keto dessert is here! It&#039;s kind of hard to like sugar free cookies when you know how to make the real thing, and really well too. 🙃

So when I say I actually ate a few and the whole batch didn&#039;t go into the garbage it&#039;s a pretty big deal. I used the @keto.connect Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe as a crutch for measurement and then went on my own way with the flavouring.

• 2 tsp Vanilla Extract
• 1/2 tsp Nutmeg
• 4 Tbs Ground Cinnamon • 1/4 tsp Xanthan Gum
• 1/4 tsp Salt

I think to give this a more spiced taste I&#039;ll add ground ginger to it next time.  The goal for next time is to work on the spreadability of the cookie. Overall I&#039;m really happy 😭 this is a huge deal for me." title="Cinnamon Spice Cookies 🍪

During the first week of January I was kind of disappointed with my diet. Yes I was still eating a low carb high fat diet but it was filled with fast food and lacked nutritional value. I ended up seeing a decrease in performance and energy levels at the gym as a result.

It was at this moment I decided to get back on the meal prep train and really be intentional about the foods I was consuming. Enter meal prep! Meal prepping is amazing because I can calculate my daily macros ahead of time and not have to stress about counting them during the day.

Since Christmas I&#039;ve been figuring out creative ways to get rid of all the turkey in my freezer. Enter this meal 😂I topped this meal up with some cheese to up the fat since turkey is such a lean meat.

Currently I&#039;m kinda over the salads. I&#039;m going back to my roots and eating copious amount of chicken thighs paired with veggies. I like hot meals better anyways.
